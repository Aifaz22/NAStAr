# NAStAr
### Work in progress

To use this, get an apikey from 'https://api.nasa.gov/' and the follow the following steps:
- create config.js file in the same directory as index.html
- create a hashmap/dictionary named config like shown below with your api key instead of ```<key here> ```
```
const config = {
  ApiKey_NASA : <key here>;
}
```
